Server side:

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

First, check if openssh-server and openssh-client is installed so we can have
the environment set up for ssh. However, the output shows that only
openssh-client was installed.

=====

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Installed openssh-server. Packages were downloaded and installed successfully.

=====

$ ssh-keygen

I first generated some public and private keys for the SSH connection.
It prompted me for a location to save it, but I just went with the default
location for this one. Then it prompted me to enter a passphrase.
After that, it successfully saved my identification and a public key,
and generated the key's fingerprint and randomart image.

=====

$ sudo useradd -d /home/anon -m anon
$ sudo passwd anon

I created an account for the client on the server and set up a password
for that account. For convenience I set the password as simply the username.
I then gave the username and password to my partners
so that they could connect.

=====

$ cd /home/anon
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Changed into the directory for the user and created a .ssh directory
for the new user there to store the keys to the host server my partners
will connect to.

=====

$ sudo chown -R anon .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then changed ownership and permission on the .ssh directory, so that I made
anon the owner of .ssh and gave read, write, and execute permissions.

=====

$ ifconfig

Get the IP address. My IP address was 10.96.85.181. I then gave this to my
partner so he could connect to my computer.

=====

Client side:

$ ssh-keygen

Generated public and private keys. Like with what happened in the
server side, it prompted me for a passphrase and saved to the default location,
and then generated a fingerprint and image.

=====

$ ssh-copy-id -i chaoran@10.97.85.173

Copied my public key to the server for key-based authentication. It first
warned me that the authenticity of the host at the IP address can't be
established and asked me if I wanted to proceed. I proceeded
and it prompted me to enter the password for the remote host. After doing that,
it showed that the keys were added and I could log in to the machine.

=====

$ ssh-add

Added a private key to the authentication agent (ssh-agent).

=====

$ ssh -X chaoran@10.97.85.173

I logged into the server via SSH and enabled X11 forwarding for my session.
I connected successfully and started a session.

=====

$ firefox

I ran a command on the remote host, which opened a browser window in Firefox,
confirming that it works.
