Q1. Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"?
Was it necessary to remove that line? Explain.

In the original file there was a goto that went to that line.
However in the patch the goto was deleted, so that line would never
be touched upon. It was not necessary to remove that line because either
way the result would be the same.

Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils
instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for?
Might this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems with your
application, perhaps in countries where users don't speak English and
don't understand English-format dates?

If another part of the program was dependent on the old date and time
format, it could malfunction due to the patched version. Since the
patched date and time format is specific for an English format, users
from other countries could be confused by it.

Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an
empty file like /dev/null, and why?

The script outputs random lines from a given file. When
run on an empty file, it returns an IndexError: list index
out of range. This may be because there are no lines in an
empty file to work with.

Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3
rather than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the
SEASnet hosts by using the command python3 instead of python.)

When invoking the script with Python 3 I get a SyntaxError
on line 65 "except IOError as (errno, strerror)". This is because
in Python 2 exceptions were iterable. However, this feature was
removed in Python 3 so it gives an error.
