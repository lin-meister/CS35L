sort --version

Run sort version to check we are using a new-enough version. The output shows
that we are at version 8.25.

=====

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

Add /usr/local/cs/bin to the path.

=====

od /dev/urandom | sed 's/ /\n/g' | head -n 10000000 > big_file.txt

Generate a file using the od command with /dev/urandom as the input. The initial
od command will create random double-precision floating point
numbers with spaces between them, and the sed command will replace all of them
with a new line so every one is on its own line. We limit it to 10,000,000
lines with head and redirect the result to big_file.txt.

=====

time -p sort -g big_file.txt > /dev/null

Use time to measure the performance of invoking the sort -g command, which
compares according to general numerical value, on big_file.txt and send it to
/dev/null. My output was:

real 11.55
user 54.60
sys 0.45

=====

Now we run the benchmark with 2, 4, and 8 threads:

time -p sort -g --parallel=2 big_file.txt > /dev/null

real 24.26
user 45.91
sys 0.23

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 big_file.txt > /dev/null
real 14.68
user 48.28
sys 0.32

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 big_file.txt > /dev/null
real 10.07
user 49.79
sys 0.48
