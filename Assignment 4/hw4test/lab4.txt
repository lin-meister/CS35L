Clones the Diffutils repository and saves it to a directory called hw4.

cd hw4

Go into the directory that was cloned above.

=====

called git-log.txt

=====

3. git tag > git-tag.txt

git-tag.txt

=====

4. git log --grep="quote 'like this'"

Use grep to search the log of commits for the one entitled "maint:
quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'". The commit id is:

62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > quote-patch.txt

Get the commit and create a patch for it, then redirect it to
a new file quote-patch.txt using the --stdout option.

=====

5. git checkout v3.0

Checkout the version 3.0 of Diffutils in the repository. Output is a note
indicating that we are checking out 'v3.0' and a message stating that
"You are in 'detached HEAD' state".

=====

6. patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

Patch the version 3.0 branch of Diffutils with quote-patch.txt. 

=====

7. git status

Get an overview of the untracked files and changes not staged for commit.
Shows all the modified and untracked files.

=====

8. emacs

Start a session with the Emacs editor.

C-h ? k C-x v =

Get help and display the documentation for the key sequence C-x v =.
The key sequence runs the vc-diff command which displays differences
between file revisions.

C-h ? k C-x v u

Get documentation for C-x v u. The key sequence runs the vc-rever command
which reverts working copies of the selected fileset to their repository
contents.

C-x v =

Switch into the diff buffer.

C-h ? C-c C-a

Get documentation for C-c C-a. The key sequence runs the diff-apply-hunk
command which will apply the changes in a diff file one by one.

C_h ? C-c C-c

Get documentation for C-c C-c. The key sequence runs the diff-goto-source
command which will jump to the corresponding source line in the source file
that the hunk in the diff buffer is on.

=====

9. C-x v u

This command reverts changes so that the files match their repository
contents. I used this to undo all changes to all files other than .c files. 

C-x v = M-n C-u C-c C-a

This command enters a file's diff mode, goes to the next hunk, and reverts
it. I used this to undo all the changes to .c files other than changes to
character string constants (outside of the comments).

=====

10. ls src/*.c.rej

Get a list of all the files ending in .c.rej. I then copied the changes
in the lines back to the corresponding .c files.

=====

=====

12. git status

As expected, shows 6 modified files, all in the src directory:
cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, sdiff.c, util.c

git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

Get the difference between branches and redirect it into the file
quote-3.0-patch.txt

cat -n quote-3.0-patch.txt

Print out the patch file to check its line count. As expected, it is
between 300 and 400 lines long.

=====

13. ./bootstrap

Get other files needed to build by extracting from other source packages.
Output returns an error that 'help2man' is not found.

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

Adds the /usr/local/cs/bin programs to the path so that we can find
help2man, which is located in that directory.

./bootstrap

Run the bootstrap command, gets the files successfully now.

wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff

Get the diffutils-gets patch using wget.

patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff

Apply the patch. Patches the file lib/stdio.in.h.

./configure

Run the configure script to prepare the system for building.

make

Build the system.

make check

Check the make

diff . -

Outputs a message telling us that cannot compare '-' to directory.

diff --help

Displays help for the diff command.

=====

14. mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
mkdir diffutils-3.0

Make a directory diffutils-3.0-patch and diffutils-3.0

cp src/*.c diffutils-3.0-patch

Copy the source code inside the current modified version of Diffutils 3.0
into the directory diffutils-3.0-patch

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils orig

Clone the original repository into a local directory orig.

cd orig

Go into the cloned original repo.

git checkout v3.0

./src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt

Compare diffutils-3.0 and diffutils-3.0-patch using our implementation of
diff and redirect into quote-3.0-test.txt

=====

15. diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

Compare the two patches. There are differences, but they are innocuous
since it seems where the files differ are just the directory locations
of the files that the two patches are modifying. Other differences are
just regarding the changes to chracter string constants.
