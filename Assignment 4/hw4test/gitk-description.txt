I took a screenshot of the latest merge before 2015-01-25.

The first window on the top left contains a timeline of the commits and
merges of the master repository. The top middle and right windows contain the
commit authors, their emails, and the date of the commit. Below the top left
window, there is a SHA ID, which is the commit's unique identifier.

For a selected commit, the lower left window contains all the file changes
between the master and the commit in diff format. The lower right window
shows the files that were changed/affected by the selected commit.
